# svelte-sass-12fa-template
This template is based on the official [svelte template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).
It includes the necessary configuration to support SCSS styles in svelte components.
Additionally, the setup of a minimal express server and Dockerfile to serve the application is provided.
With this it is possible to write an 12-Factor-App including setting environment variables during build time.
